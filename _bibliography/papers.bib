	abstract = {A totally oriented Klein graph is a trivalent spatial graph in the 3-sphere with a 3-coloring of its edges and an orientation on each bicolored link. A totally oriented Klein foam is a 3-colored 2-complex in the 4-ball whose boundary is a Klein foam and whose bicolored surfaces are oriented. We extend Gille-Robert's signature for 3-Hamiltonian Klein graphs to all totally oriented Klein graphs and develop an analogy of Murasugi's bounds relating the signature, slice genus and unknotting number of knots. In particular, we show that the signature of a totally oriented Klein graph produces a lower bound on the negative orbifold Euler characteristic of certain totally oriented Klein foams bounded by Γ. When Γ is abstractly planar, these negative Euler characteristics, in turn, produce a lower bound on a certain natural unknotting number for Γ. Mutatis mutandi, we produce lower bounds on the corresponding Gordian distance between two totally oriented Klein graphs that can be related by a sequence of crossing changes. We also give examples of theta-curves for which our lower bounds on unknotting number improve on previously known bounds.},

	abstract = {A theta curve is a spatial embedding of the $\theta$-graph in the three-sphere, taken up to ambient isotopy. We define the determinant of a theta curve as an integer-valued invariant arising from the first homology of its Klein cover. When a theta curve is simple, containing a constituent unknot, we prove that the determinant of the theta curve is the product of the determinants of the constituent knots. Our proofs are combinatorial, relying on Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem and spanning tree enumeration results for symmetric, signed, planar graphs.},

	abstract = {We define a broad class of graphs that generalize the Gordian graph of knots. These knot graphs take into account unknotting operations, the concordance relation, and equivalence relations generated by knot invariants. We prove that overwhelmingly, the knot graphs are not Gromov hyperbolic, with the exception of a particular family of quotient knot graphs. We also investigate the property of homogeneity, and prove that the concordance knot graph is homogeneous. Finally, we prove that that for any n, there exists a knot K such that the ball of radius n in the Gordian graph centered at K contains no connected sum of torus knots.},
