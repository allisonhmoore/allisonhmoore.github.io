	abstract = {A totally oriented Klein graph is a trivalent spatial graph in the 3-sphere with a 3-coloring of its edges and an orientation on each bicolored link. A totally oriented Klein foam is a 3-colored 2-complex in the 4-ball whose boundary is a Klein foam and whose bicolored surfaces are oriented. We extend Gille-Robert's signature for 3-Hamiltonian Klein graphs to all totally oriented Klein graphs and develop an analogy of Murasugi's bounds relating the signature, slice genus and unknotting number of knots. In particular, we show that the signature of a totally oriented Klein graph produces a lower bound on the negative orbifold Euler characteristic of certain totally oriented Klein foams bounded by Γ. When Γ is abstractly planar, these negative Euler characteristics, in turn, produce a lower bound on a certain natural unknotting number for Γ. Mutatis mutandi, we produce lower bounds on the corresponding Gordian distance between two totally oriented Klein graphs that can be related by a sequence of crossing changes. We also give examples of theta-curves for which our lower bounds on unknotting number improve on previously known bounds.},

We define the determinant of a theta curve as an integer-valued invariant arising from the first homology of its Klein cover. When a theta curve is simple, containing a constituent unknot, we prove that the determinant of the theta curve is the product of the determinants of the constituent knots. Our proofs are combinatorial, relying on Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem and spanning tree enumeration results for symmetric, signed, planar graphs.},

We show, in all cases considered, that the quotient graphs are Gromov hyperbolic. We then prove a collection of results about the graph isomorphism type of the quotient graphs.

We give a formula for the Heegaard Floer d-invariants of integral surgeries on two-component L-space links of linking number zero in terms of the h-function, generalizing a formula of Ni and Wu. As a consequence, for such links with unknotted components, we characterize L-space surgery slopes in terms of the nu-+invariants of the knots obtained from blowing down the components. 
We give a proof of a skein inequality for the d-invariants of +1 surgeries along linking number zero links that differ by a crossing change. We also describe bounds on the smooth four-genus of links in terms of the h-function, expanding on previous work of the second author, and use these bounds to calculate the four-genus in several examples of links.},

The main result is proved by studying the behavior of the Heegaard Floer d-invariants under integral surgery along knots in L(3,1). The classification of band surgeries between the trefoil and torus knots and links is motivated by local reconnection processes in nature, which are modeled as band surgeries.

Specifically, given a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbing tree, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of Laurent series which are invariant up to Neumann moves between plumbing trees and the action of the Weyl group of the root lattice. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least $2$, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our invariants recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park, and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},
