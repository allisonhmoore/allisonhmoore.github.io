	abstract = {A totally oriented Klein graph is a trivalent spatial graph in the 3-sphere with a 3-coloring of its edges and an orientation on each bicolored link. A totally oriented Klein foam is a 3-colored 2-complex in the 4-ball whose boundary is a Klein foam and whose bicolored surfaces are oriented. We extend Gille-Robert's signature for 3-Hamiltonian Klein graphs to all totally oriented Klein graphs and develop an analogy of Murasugi's bounds relating the signature, slice genus and unknotting number of knots. In particular, we show that the signature of a totally oriented Klein graph produces a lower bound on the negative orbifold Euler characteristic of certain totally oriented Klein foams bounded by Γ. When Γ is abstractly planar, these negative Euler characteristics, in turn, produce a lower bound on a certain natural unknotting number for Γ. Mutatis mutandi, we produce lower bounds on the corresponding Gordian distance between two totally oriented Klein graphs that can be related by a sequence of crossing changes. We also give examples of theta-curves for which our lower bounds on unknotting number improve on previously known bounds.},

	abstract = {A theta curve is a spatial embedding of the theta-graph in the three-sphere, taken up to ambient isotopy. We define the determinant of a theta curve as an integer-valued invariant arising from the first homology of its Klein cover. When a theta curve is simple, containing a constituent unknot, we prove that the determinant of the theta curve is the product of the determinants of the constituent knots. Our proofs are combinatorial, relying on Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem and spanning tree enumeration results for symmetric, signed, planar graphs.},

We also construct L-space knots with arbitrarily large tunnel number and discuss the question of whether L-space knots admit essential tangle decompositions in the context of satellite operations and tunnel number.},

	abstract = {The Gordian graph and H(2)-Gordian graphs of knots are abstract graphs whose vertex sets represent isotopy classes of unoriented knots, and whose edge sets record whether pairs of knots are related by crossing changes or H(2)-moves, respectively. We investigate quotients of these graphs under equivalence relations defined by several knot invariants including the determinant, the span of the Jones polynomial, and an invariant related to tricolorability. We show, in all cases considered, that the quotient graphs are Gromov hyperbolic. We then prove a collection of results about the graph isomorphism type of the quotient graphs. In particular, we find that the H(2)-Gordian graph of links modulo the relation induced by the span of the Jones polynomial is isomorphic with the complete graph on infinitely many vertices.},

For such links, we explicitly describe the relationship between the h-function, the Sato-Levine invariant and the Casson invariant. We give a formula for the Heegaard Floer d-invariants of integral surgeries on two-component L-space links of linking number zero in terms of the h-function, generalizing a formula of Ni and Wu. As a consequence, for such links with unknotted components, we characterize L-space surgery slopes in terms of the nu-+invariants of the knots obtained from blowing down the components. 
We give a proof of a skein inequality for the d-invariants of +1 surgeries along linking number zero links that differ by a crossing change. We also describe bounds on the smooth four-genus of links in terms of the h-function, expanding on previous work of the second author, and use these bounds to calculate the four-genus in several examples of links.},

We also investigate the property of homogeneity, and prove that the concordance knot graph is homogeneous. Finally, we prove that that for any n, there exists a knot K such that the ball of radius n in the Gordian graph centered at K contains no connected sum of torus knots.},
