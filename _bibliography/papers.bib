@article{JLM,
	abstract = {We define a broad class of graphs that generalize the Gordian graph of knots. These knot graphs take into account unknotting operations, the concordance relation, and equivalence relations generated by knot invariants. We prove that overwhelmingly, the knot graphs are not Gromov hyperbolic, with the exception of a particular family of quotient knot graphs. We also investigate the property of homogeneity, and prove that the concordance knot graph is homogeneous. Finally, we prove that that for any n, there exists a knot K such that the ball of radius n in the Gordian graph centered at K contains no connected sum of torus knots.},
