<b>Currently</b>:

In Spring 2025, I am teaching:

- Linear Algebra, Math 300, Spring 2025
- Advanced Linear Algebra, Math 610, Spring 2025

For linear algebra students, I have a series of linear algebra tutorials online: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1oREv7xaaknZHxESRhMP24GeL9-xABFi">Linear Algebra on YouTube</a>. Enrolled students can also access lecture notes, practice exams and other materials in Canvas.


<b>Prospective student researchers:</b> VCU undergraduates or graduate students curious about a research project, summer project, or interested in doing a reading course, do please get in touch with me by email (moorea14 at VCU dot edu). I'm often looking for student collaborators and would love to hear from you.

I am also heading the Undergraduate Research committee! Even if you want to work with a different professor or on an unrelated project, undergraduates are welcome to get in touch with me for advice, help with applications, or information about conferences and workshops where you can present your work. Stop by my office HH 4145, or drop me an email.
