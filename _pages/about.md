My research interests are in low-dimensional topology and geometry, especially knots, links and their relationships with three and four-manifolds. This involves some [Floer homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology#Heegaard_Floer_homology">Floer homology) (particularly Heegaard Floer homology) and Khovanov homology. I am also interested in the applications of knot theory to the study of entanglement in DNA and RNA. My work has been supported by the [Jeffress Trust Award](https://hria.org/tmf/jeffress/) in Interdisciplinary Research and the National Science Foundation, [DMSâ€“2204148](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204148&HistoricalAwards=false). 

Prior to arriving at VCU, I was a Krener Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu) from 2016-2019. For two of those years, I also held a joint appointment as a postdoc in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, collaborating with the [Topological Molecular Biology lab](http://arsuaga-vazquez-lab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/).

From 2013-2016, I was an RTG Lovett Instructor of Mathematics at [Rice University](https://math.rice.edu/), in Houston, Texas. I worked in low-dimensional topology. I received my Ph.D. in 2013 at [The University of Texas](https://www.ma.utexas.edu) under the direction of [Cameron Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Gordon_(mathematician)).
